## General Information
The Word Ladder Solver is a tool designed to solve the classic word puzzle known as the Word Ladder. Given a start word and an end word, the solver algorithmically finds the shortest transformation path between the two words, with each step changing only one letter at a time while ensuring that each intermediate word is valid and exists in a predefined dictionary. This program provides an interactive interface for users to input their start and end words and select from various search algorithms, such as Uniform Cost Search, Greedy Best First Search, and A*, to find the optimal solution efficiently.
